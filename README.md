NYPD Shooting Data Report

The data we will be looking at is the NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) which lists every shooting incident that occurred in NYC from 2006 to 2021. 
We will import, clean, transform, visualize, analyze, and model the data.

We were able to create a few visualizations that gave us a glimpse into the trends seen in the shooting incidents.
